    <td colspan="2"><p class="verdana8">We, Grapple (UK) Limited, need to collect certain 
        personal details from you in order to process your orders and requirements. These details 
        will include, where applicable, the names and addresses (including email 
        addresses) of party members, credit/ debit card or other payment details 
        and perhaps special requirements such as those relating to any disability 
        or medical condition which may affect your chosen arrangements. </p>
      <p class="verdana8">We may need to pass on your personal details to the companies 
        and organisations who need to know them so that your order can be provided 
        (for example the Owner of accommodation you choose, and your/our credit/debit 
        card company or bank). Such companies and organisations may be outside 
        the European Union, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein if your holiday is 
        to take place or to Owner(s) outside these countries. <em>[We would also 
        like to store and use your personal details for future marketing purposes 
        (for example, sending you a brochure or details of a promotion)</em>]. 
        All details you give us in connection with your booking will be kept [<em>but 
        we will use only names and contact details for marketing purposes</em>]. 
        [<em>Occasionally, we may sell clients names and addresses to other companies 
        or organisations who offer goods or services which we feel may interest 
        you. If you do not want us to do any or all of these things, please let 
        us know as soon as possible</em>]. We are entitled to assume you do not 
        object to our doing any of the things mentioned in this statement unless 
        you tell us otherwise in writing.</p>
      <p class="verdana8">Except where expressly permitted by the Data Protection 
        Act, we will only deal with the personal details you give us as set out 
        above unless you agree otherwise. We have appropriate security measures 
        in place to protect this information. </p>
      <p class="verdana8">If you believe that any of your personal details which 
        we are processing are inaccurate or incorrect please contact us immediately.</p>
      <p class="verdana8"><br>
        Notes</p>
      <p class="verdana8">1.. The Data Protection Act applies to virtually all 
        information concerning any individual which is capable (if only in theory) 
        of identifying that individual. It applies to information you just store 
        (even if this is only because your systems do not allow you to delete 
        the information without a massive amount of work) as well as information 
        you actually use or pass on. The word &#8220;process&#8221; in the following 
        includes simple storing.</p>
      <p class="verdana8">2. The Data Protection Act draws a distinction between 
        personal data and sensitive personal data. The later comprises a list 
        of information of which only that relating to physical or mental health 
        or condition is likely to be relevant to holidays unless you start collecting 
        data relating to political opinions, racial/ethnic origins or similar! 
      </p>
      <p class="verdana8">3. In order to &#8220;process&#8221; non sensitive personal 
        data, you need to demonstrate consent or that doing so is necessary for 
        the performance of a contract to which the &#8220;data subject&#8221; 
        is a party (there are other possibilities but these are not likely to 
        be relevant). </p>
      <p class="verdana8">4. In order to &#8220;process&#8221; sensitive personal 
        data, you need to demonstrate &#8220;explicit&#8221; consent (again, there 
        are other possibilities but these are not likely to be relevant). </p>
      <p class="verdana8">5. What is meant by &#8220;consent&#8221;, explicit 
        or otherwise is not defined in the Act. Logically, &#8220;explicit&#8221; 
        consent must involve specific and, to prove this has genuinely been given, 
        written agreement from the individual concerned. Ideally you should certainly 
        work on this basis. Such &#8220;explicit&#8221; consent could be obtained 
        via, for example, appropriate wording and a box to tick on the booking 
        form. This is definitely the preferable approach but I appreciate this 
        process involves extra work and potential hassle. I am aware many if not 
        most operators take the view that this is not a practical option. If you 
        are of this opinion, I would hope it will be possible to successfully 
        argue that going to such lengths is not necessary given the sensitive 
        data is only being used to enable the Owners to provide appropriate holiday 
        arrangements and assistance. As the majority of clients we deal with do 
        not want to have to seek express written consent to deal with &#8220;sensitive&#8221; 
        personal data, the above statement has been worded on the basis that such 
        consent will be assumed unless you are told otherwise in writing. Unfortunately, 
        I cannot promise that this approach will be acceptable to the Information 
        Commissioner. If you prefer to be cautious and obtain express consent, 
        please let us know and alternative wording can be provided.</p>
      <p class="verdana8">6. So far as &#8220;non-sensitive&#8221; personal information 
        necessary to provide the holiday is concerned, giving the above statement 
        should be sufficient without obtaining express agreement given you can 
        rely on the &#8220;contract performance&#8221; justification. </p>
      <p class="verdana8">7. The above wording in italics assumes you will use 
        the information you collect from clients for your own future marketing 
        purposes and to pass on to third parties. If this is not the case, the 
        wording needs amending. To be entitled to do so, the Act requires you 
        to obtain consent. It is not clear what this requires in practice. As 
        you cannot rely on the &#8220;performance of the contract justification&#8221; 
        in this context, you should, in our view, at least give clients a simple 
        mechanism for opting out of future marketing by you and/or third parties. 
        An &#8220;opt in&#8221; (i.e. the client will not be marketed unless they 
        expressly agree) is definitely a safer, if rather less practical approach. 
        If you decide to use an &#8220;opt in&#8221;, the above statement will 
        need slightly amending.</p>
      <p class="verdana8">8. Whilst not spelt out in the Act itself, however, 
        the Act appears to require that such a statement should be communicated 
        prior to the collection of any data. Accordingly, the logical position 
        for this statement is on the booking form/page and anywhere else personal 
        details are given pre booking. If you have no space for it on such documents, 
        you could alternatively include it in a prominent position on your website 
        and add a clear cross reference to this wherever information is actually 
        requested. </p>
      <p class="verdana8">9. If you have any queries or would like to amend the 
        above or are not entirely clear as to the extent of your responsibilities 
        under the Data Protection Act, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
